osu! Beatmap API
===============

An API designed for quick and painless parsing of osu! beatmap files in .NET. This API exposes the 'Beatmap' class for .NET applications to use.
Currently supports reading, creating and saving osu! beatmap file formats up to v12.

What you need to be able to use it:
-----------------------------------
.NET Framework 3.5


Directions for use:
-------------------
To use this API you must add a reference to the DLL file in your project (Project -> Add Reference) and add 'using BMAPI' (or the equivalent for your language) to the top of your project.

If you are working with the source files instead (thus working in C#) and compiling the API along with your program, you do not need to add a reference to the DLL file, however the API files must be added to your project (Right click solution -> Add -> Existing Item).


Usage example:
--------------
In VB.NET:
```VB.NET
'Load the beatmap into a new object
Dim bm As New BMAPI.Beatmap("C:\osu!\Songs\39804 xi - FREEDOM DiVE\xi - FREEDOM DiVE (Nakagawa-Kanon) [FOUR DIMENSIONS].osu")
'Display the approach rate to the user
Console.WriteLine(bm.ApproachRate)
'Change the approach rate to a more 'appropriate' number
bm.ApproachRate = 10
'Let's also change the version to make the map distinguishable from the other maps in the mapset
bm.Version = "Best AR Version"
'Finally, save the beatmap!
bm.Save("C:\osu!\Songs\39804 xi - FREEDOM DiVE\xi - FREEDOM DiVE (Nakagawa-Kanon) [Best AR Version].osu")
```

In C#:
```C#
//Load the beatmap into a new object
BMAPI.Beatmap bm = new BMAPI.Beatmap(@"C:\osu!\Songs\39804 xi - FREEDOM DiVE\xi - FREEDOM DiVE (Nakagawa-Kanon) [FOUR DIMENSIONS].osu");
//Display the approach rate to the user
Console.Writeline(bm.ApproachRate);
//Change the approach rate to a more 'fitting' number
bm.ApproachRate = 10;
//Let's also change the version to make the map distinguishable from the other maps in the mapset
bm.Version = "Best AR Version";
//Finally, save the beatmap!
bm.Save(@"C:\osu!\Songs\39804 xi - FREEDOM DiVE\xi - FREEDOM DiVE (Nakagawa-Kanon) [Best AR Version].osu");
```

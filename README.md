# VirtualRhythm

A Rhythm game for HTC Vive using OSU beatmaps. It currently only has a single gamemode which is similar to Audioshield.

Guide to playing:
Place Folders with .osu files in the "Songs" Directory. Osz-files have to be unpacked first, for example with 7zip. Only Taiko-maps work currently.
Select a song with the laser pointer (menu key), trigger to confirm. To start the song, press the start button.

Guide for Unity:
To run the Unity project with all effects you will need to get the following free plugins from the Asset store:
-fxfire
-sky5x
-Simple Particle Effects
